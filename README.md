# Setup

## Installation

Download Docker desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). And follow all the instruction guidelines. Make sure to choose correct version of installer for Windows (AMD64 in my case).
After installing make sure to restart the system and later open command prompt and run the command `docker version`. This should render the client and server information.
